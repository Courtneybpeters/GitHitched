			<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
		</div>
		<p>Five years ago, FIVE YEARS GUYS, during a magical week long ice/snow storm in Dallas, Luke and Courtney went on their first date. After meeting online, connecting over trebuchets, Rubik's cubes, and Kid Cudi (old Cudi), the two decided to meet up for an action packed night in the snow (Luke is a VERY impressive winter driver btw.) I'm pretty certain any couple that has a first kiss with snow falling in Texas is a sealed deal - ghrm, back to. third. person.</p>

		<p>But soon a wrench was thrown in their plans: Luke was moving back to Wimberley soon! ***Interesting sidenote: Luke and Courtney were both born in Carrollton but Luke soon moved to Wimberley for most of his life yet they somehow met again 20 years later back in Dallas! Pretty positive we fell in love at first sight as kids.*** All it took was a trip down to the beautiful hill country and Courtney was sold. Six months after meeting, Luke and Courtney left the city and started building an incredible life in Austin where they couldn't be happier.</p>

		<p>Besides the two of us, we also have quite an extensive fur-baby pack. Peter was the OG until 2012 when we adopted Lucy on the Mayan Apocalypse (no seriously, our shelter was running a promo thanks to it.) After we bought our house earlier this year, Caterpie (its a Pokemon reference) aka Cat R. P. (Cat Robert Pawson - Fight Club anyone?) aka Our Third Dog joined the crew. We love our very beautiful life as a little family so come celebrate it with us!</p>

			<h3>THE PROPOSAL</h3>
		</div>
		<p>It was supposed to be a lazy Sunday after a tiring day trip to Dallas the day before. Courtney was lounging pretty hard, to the point she even busted out
		a puzzle (It was a risky move for Luke, Courtney had been known to go pretty hard at puzzles and there was nothing on her schedule that day.) Thankfully, Luke planted the
		seed in Courtney's head of a nice evening of exploring Wimberley with our cameras followed by a "nice dinner, maybe."</p>

		<p>Soon they got ready and headed out to one of their favorite spots, a place that first wowed Courtney on her first trip to the Hill Country: Fulton Rd. Eventually they hit their favorite spot and decided to set
		up a tripod to snap some pictures together. Luke had Courtney stand majestically on a rock and pointed the camera towards her and the beautiful sunset quickly settling below the horizon.
		After snapping a few photos, Luke fiddled with the camera for an unusually long time, Courtney was starting to wonder. Nervous and excited, eventually he came over, kneeled
		down and among the beautiful quiet country asked her to spend the rest of her life with him! And since you're reading this, SPOILER ALERT!</p>

			<h3>THE CEREMONY</h3>
		</div>
		<p>The intimate ceremony will be held at Chapel Dulcinea at 3:30pm on Saturday, the 6th of February 2016. There is limited seating however so all benches will be reserved for close family.</p>
		<div class="title">
			<h3>THE RECEPTION</h3>
		</div>
		<p>Here we will have drinks, food, cake, music, good conversations, and anything else you might want. Probably.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="title">
			<h3>DRESS CODE</h3>
		</div>
		<p>Whatever you are willing to be remembered by in lots and lots of photos... And whatever will keep us on friendly terms.</p>

			<h3>GIFTS</h3>
		</div>
		<p>As you're probably quickly realizing we aren't very traditional and the same goes for gifts. While we absolutely love Target and all the adorable wood/owl themed decor as much as the next hipster, we also prefer a minimalistic lifestyle. So if you're feeling gift inclined, please consider donating to the Paireeepinarts Buy Furniture For A House Foundation.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 50%;">*Although, we will accept exactly 2 copies of PvZ:GW 2. If you understand this message, please coordinate with others to ensure no duplicates.</p>

			<h3>LETS JUST SAY WHAT WE'RE ALL THINKING</h3>

		</div>
		<p>We know, we know. You're thinking, I really care about Luke and Courtney but I just don't know if their wedding is worth missing out on Super Bowl Sunday. Tough choices, amirite?! But no need to worry. While we might be the most terrible wedding planners out there, we've got you covered. Sunday we will be hosting an epic brunch (migas and mimosas, YUM) followed by a Super Bowl watch party later that afternoon.</p>
		<p>Still aren't convinced? Our 120" projector setup and JBL sound system has got you covered. Beer? Check. Fried food? Check. Pizza? Probably. Queso? Most definitely. Cowboys fans? Limited.</p>
		<p><b>Details:</b> Migas start around 11 ...probably. Unless we go hard at the reception. Stay tuned.</p>
