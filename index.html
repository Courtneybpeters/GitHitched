				<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
			</div>
			<p>...Like if you're getting invited to our wedding you don't already know about us...</p>
			<p>Five years ago, FIVE YEARS GUYS, during a magical week long ice/snow storm in Dallas, Luke and Courtney went on their first date. After meeting online, connecting over trebuchets, Rubik's cubes, and Kid Cudi (old Cudi), the two decided to meet up for an action packed night in the snow (Luke is a VERY impressive winter driver btw.) I'm pretty certain any couple that has a first kiss with snow falling in Texas is a sealed deal - ghrm, back to. third. person.</p>

			<p>But soon a wrench was thrown in their plans: Luke was moving back to Wimberley soon! ***Interesting sidenote: Luke and Courtney were both born in Carrollton but Luke soon moved to Wimberley for most of his life yet they somehow met again 20 years later back in Dallas! Pretty positive we fell in love at first sight as kids.*** All it took was a trip down to the beautiful hill country and Courtney was sold. Six months after meeting, Luke and Courtney left the city and started building an incredible life in Austin where they couldn't be happier.</p>

			<p>Besides the two of us, we also have quite an extensive fur baby pack. Peter was the OG until 2012 when we adopted Lucy on the Mayan Apocalypse (no seriously, our shelter was running a promo thanks to it.) After we bought our house earlier this year, Caterpie (its a Pokemon reference) aka Cat R. P. (P for Peters/Paireepinart) aka Our Third Dog joined the crew. We love our very beautiful life as a little family so come celebrate it with us!</p>

				<h3>THE PROPOSAL</h3>
			</div>
			<p>It was supposed to be a lazy Sunday after a tiring day trip to Dallas the day before. Courtney was lounging pretty hard, to the point she even busted out
			a puzzle (It was a risky move for Luke, Courtney had been known to go pretty hard at puzzles and there was nothing on her schedule that day.) Thankfully, Luke planted the
			seed in Courtney's head of a nice evening of exploring Wimberley with our cameras followed by a "nice dinner, maybe." Soon they got ready and headed out to one of their favorite spots, a place that first wowed Courtney on her first trip to the Hill Country: Fulton Rd. Eventually they hit their favorite spot and decided to set
			up a tripod to snap some pictures together. Luke had Courtney stand majestically on a rock and pointed the camera towards her and the beautiful sunset quickly settling below the horizon. 
			After snapping a few photos, Luke fiddled with the camera for an unusually long time, Courtney was starting to wonder. Nervous and excited, eventually he came over, kneedled
			down and among the beautiful quiet country asked her to spend the rest of her life with him! And since you're reading this, SPOILER ALERT! She said yes.</p>

				<h3>THE RECEPTION</h3>
			</div>

				<h3>GIFTS</h3>
			</div>
			<p>As you're probably quickly realizing we aren't very traditional and the same goes for gifts. While we absolutely love Target and all the adorable wood/owl themed decor as much as the next hipster, we also prefer a minimalistic lifestyle. So if you're feeling gift inclined, please consider donating to the Paireeepinarts Buy Furniture For A House Foundation.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 50%;">..Although, we will accept exactly 2 copies of PvZ:GW 2. If you understand this message, please coordinate with others to ensure no duplicates.</p>
