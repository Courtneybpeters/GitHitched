				<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Five years ago, FIVE YEARS GUYS, during a magical week long ice/snow storm in Dallas, Luke and Courtney went on their first date. After meeting online, connecting over trebuchets, Rubik's cubes, and Kid Cudi (old Cudi), the two decided to meet up for an action packed night in the snow (Luke is a VERY impressive winter driver btw.) I'm pretty certain any couple that has a first kiss with snow falling in Texas is a sealed deal - ghrm, back to. third. person. </p>

			<p>But soon a wrench was thrown in their plans: Luke was moving back to Wimberley soon! *** Interesting sidenote: Luke and Courtney were both born in Carrollton but Luke soon moved to Wimberley for most of his life yet they somehow met again 20 years later back in Dallas! Pretty positive we fell in love at first sight as kids. *** All it took was a trip down to the beautiful country and Courtney was sold. So six months after meeting, Luke and Courtney left the city and started building an incredible life in Austin where they couldn't be happier. </p>

			<p>Peter was the OG fur baby until 2012 when we adopted Lucy on the Mayan Apocalypse (no seriously, our shelter was running a promo thanks to it.) After we bought our house earlier this year, Caterpie (its a Pokemon reference) aka Cat R. P aka Our Third Dog joined the crew. We love our very beautiful life as a little family so come celebrate it with us!</p>
